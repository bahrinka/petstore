### Petstore Kata  
##  By: Ken Bahringer

## Task

Create a web page or mobile app that allows user to interact with the  
self-documenting API offered by https://petstore.swagger.io.  There is
a 30 minute time constraint.

## Approach  

Gain an understanding of the Petstore API
    - There are three endpoints: Pet, Store and User
	- The Swagger API allows a pet to be added and queried
	- The inventory by status endpoint can be used
	  for a dashboard view.
	- The pets by status endpoint can be used
	  for a list view

Choose modern web technologies with rich functionality that can be quickly  
built and deployed for the purpose of this exercise.  
    - Ionic with Angular
    - Typescript
    - Java
    - Spring/Spring Boot
    - CSS3/SCSS

An Ionic with Angular frontend will demonstrate a Progressive Web App,
      Android and IOS apps.

A Java Spring Boot backend can host the PWA assets. Also, it could be
used to provide extra API type functionality. It demonstrates
how a custom RESTful API can be integrated into a stack.
